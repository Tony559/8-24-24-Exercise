            <h2>My favorite game</h2>
            <p>My favorite game is <em><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh" style="color:pink; text-decoration: none">osu!</a></em> This is a rhythm game that was made by the developer, Peppy. The premise of this game is extremely simple, but the skill ceiling is also very high.</p>
            
            <h3>What I have achieved in this game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I have reached rank <strong><a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/itsdaki" style="color:pink; text-decoration: none">7,684</a></strong> out of <strong>24,000,000</strong></li>
                <li>I have full comboed certain songs, or maps, that I had the goal of when I started the game, as well as take #1 on a certain map</li>
                <li>The map I have taken the #1 spot in is <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2161438#osu/4576281" style="color:pink; text-decoration: none">Absolute Zero</a></li>
                <li>This map, <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/382400#osu/1001682" style="color:pink; text-decoration: none">Through the Fire and Flames</a> is one of the maps I have wanted to full combo since the start and at this point, I have done it with ease.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>My goals for the future in this game</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>I want to be able to stream higher bpms, I am currently capped at around 180-190bpm</li>
                <li>I want to be able to consistently set higher quality plays on maps</li>
                <li>I want to reach at least rank 5,000 by the end of 2024</li>
                <li>I want to set a play that is worth 600 performance points (current personal record is 500)</li>
            </ol>
